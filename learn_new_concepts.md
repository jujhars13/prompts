# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

I’m a mentor to a young colleague who’s having difficulty adjusting to [whatever you want to adjust to but are finding it difficult to do so]. 

What are 10 deep questions I can ask to discover the root of the problem? They’ve proven themselves capable of new challenges but create blocks for themselves when moving out of their comfort zone. Please stress the philosophy of feeling comfortable being uncomfortable. Include some questions an experienced and trustworthy coach would ask.

Example:
I added “In his new role of an announcer for a big team in front of a big audience” in the brackets and this is what ChatGPT gave me. Amazing, It not only helps you find the root cause of the problem but helps you overcome the mental barriers and solve that problem.
